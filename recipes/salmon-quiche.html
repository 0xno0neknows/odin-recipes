    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
    My father made this while I was growing up on the holidays for family who didn't like turkey or ham. 
    It's become a staple in my holiday dinners as well. 
    I have never served it to someone who didn't love it and beg for the family recipe after. We always make two and freeze one for later! It is excellent paired with a side of grilled asparagus.
